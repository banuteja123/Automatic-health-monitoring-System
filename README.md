Overview:
The solution is to create an integrated Automatic Health Monitoring System (AHMS) that collects, stores, and maintains patients' health data automatically. The system will be particularly beneficial for rural and sub-urban communities where access to regular healthcare services is limited, and maintaining physical diagnosis reports is challenging.

Key Features:

Wearable Health Devices: Patients will be equipped with wearable devices that continuously monitor vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc. These devices will be connected to the AHMS via IoT.

Data Collection and Storage: The system will automatically collect data from wearable devices and store it securely in a cloud-based database. The data will be encrypted to ensure patient privacy.

Automatic Report Generation: The system will generate detailed health reports based on the collected data. These reports will be updated in real-time and can be accessed by both patients and healthcare providers via a mobile app or web portal.

Alert System: The AHMS will have an alert system to notify patients and their families about any abnormal health readings. It will also notify healthcare providers if immediate attention is required.

Data Analytics: The system will use data analytics to provide insights into the patientâ€™s health trends over time. This will help in early detection of potential health issues, thereby reducing the need for frequent visits to healthcare facilities.

Integration with Healthcare Providers: The system will be integrated with local healthcare providers, allowing them to access patients' health data remotely. This will enable doctors to provide consultation and treatment without the need for physical visits, saving time and reducing healthcare costs.

Patient Profile: Each patient will have a digital profile that includes their medical history, current diagnosis reports, medications, and other relevant health information. This profile will be easily accessible and updatable by healthcare professionals.
